# jos_faust
C++ Modules for use with the JUCE Framework, generated from jos functions in the Faust Libraries

Add this jos_faust folder as a new module in Projucer, or
drag it into your JUCE modules directory.

#Why?

Since Faust compiles to C++, there is no real need for this module.  However, it offers the following benefits:

    * No Faust installation required.  The C++ here is tracked source.
    * When working with JUCE, a ready-to-use JUCE-format C++ module is convenient to have.
    * Doxygen documentation (like JUCE's) is generated.
    * More "curation" of modules, while the Faust Libraries Distribution is more open, as it should be.

#Status

Just getting started. Two reverberators so far, plus the Doxygen mechanics.
